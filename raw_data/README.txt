File names including 'national' are for the U.S., aggregated from county level data with device counts as weights. Similar for the states. In the county files, the county name is in the first row, with FIPS code ?in the variable name. File names including MSA are for metro statistical areas (MSA), aggregated from county data using the March 2020 crosswalk found here:https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/demo/metro-micro/delineation-files.html. MSA names are in the first row, and CBSA codes in the variable name.

File names including 'scaled' have the national index average over January-February subtracted out, and divided by the national value in the week ended April 11, the national index peak. These can be interpreted as relative to the national peak social distancing.

File names including 'weekly' are averages of the daily data. The data corresponds to the last day of the calendar week.
